# DeFi Empire: Building a DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche

## Overview

Welcome to **DeFi Empire**, an exciting project where you'll build a clone of the popular blockchain-based game DeFi Kingdom on the Avalanche network! By setting up a custom EVM subnet and deploying key smart contracts, you’ll create a foundation for a digital world where players can collect, build, and earn rewards through gameplay.

Through this project, you’ll deploy two fundamental smart contracts (ERC20 and Vault), learn how to create custom tokens, and understand the basics of game-based DeFi on Avalanche.

## Project Details

This project is built on Avalanche's EVM-compatible subnet, where you’ll have the freedom to:
- **Define a Native Currency**: Create a custom token to serve as in-game currency.
- **Create Game Contracts**: Deploy smart contracts for key game functions (trading, battling, exploring) and manage assets with Vault functionality.
- **Interact Through Metamask**: Add your subnet to Metamask and test your game’s features using a user-friendly web interface.

### Key Features
1. **ERC20 Token Contract**: A custom token contract that forms the basis of your in-game currency. Users can mint, transfer, and burn tokens as they participate in various game activities.
2. **Vault Contract**: A secure storage contract where players can deposit and withdraw tokens, with a system of shares to manage ownership.

### Smart Contracts Overview

#### ERC20 Contract
The ERC20 contract is a custom token that enables:
- **Minting and Burning**: Players can mint tokens to increase their holdings or burn tokens to reduce the supply.
- **Transfers and Allowances**: Standard ERC20 transfer and approval functions allow for smooth gameplay interactions.

#### Vault Contract
The Vault contract functions as the core asset manager:
- **Deposit/Withdraw Mechanism**: Players can deposit tokens to earn shares, which represent their stake in the Vault.
- **Share System**: The Vault tracks shares, ensuring that deposits and withdrawals reflect each player’s portion of the total assets.

## Prerequisites

To successfully deploy and interact with your contracts, you’ll need:
- **Unix-based Operating System** (MacOS or Linux)
- **Solidity** development environment
- **Remix** IDE for deploying and testing contracts
- **Metamask** browser extension to connect to your Avalanche subnet
